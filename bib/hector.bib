Intrinsic Intentionality is a natural biological phenomenon, caused by processes in the brain and realized in the structure of the brain. This view makes it possible to see how both naive mentalism and naive physicalism can be true. Intentional causation is crucial to the production and explanation of actions. This form of causation has special logical features not common to other kinds of causation. Teleology is an intrinsic feature of certain biological organisms.},
